# Securing Immich with mTLS using a reverse proxy

Immich supports using a custom client certificate on both web and mobile apps, so it's one of the easiest and safest ways to limit access to only clients of your choice.

## Authenticating with mutual TLS

The process of generating the certificates is the same regardless of which reverse proxy you use. Just make sure to place the folder "certs/" under a volume that is mounted to your reverse proxy container.

### Generate your client certificate

This is a basic way to generate a certificate for a user. If it's only you using your own homelab, then you'll just need to make one certificate.

This certificate will last for ~10 years (although of course you can revoke it at any time by deleting it from your reverse proxy key store).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p certs

# Generate CA certificates
openssl genrsa -out certs/client-ca.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 3600 -key certs/client-ca.key -out certs/client-ca.crt

# Generate a certificate signing request
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout certs/client.key -out certs/client.req

# Have the CA sign the certificate requests and output the certificates.
openssl x509 -req -in certs/client.req -days 3600 -CA certs/client-ca.crt -CAkey certs/client-ca.key -set_serial 01 -out certs/client.crt

echo
echo "Please enter a STRONG password. Many clients *require* a password for you to be able to import the certificate, and you want to protect it."
echo

# Convert the cerificate to PKCS12 format (for import into browser)
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certs/client.pfx -inkey certs/client.key -in certs/client.crt

# Clean up
rm certs/client.req
```

## Using Caddy
### Caddy docker-compose.yaml

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "6443:443"
      - "6443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:Z
      - ./site:/srv:Z
      - ./data:/data:Z
      - ./config:/config:Z
```
### Configure Caddyfile

```Caddyfile
https://immich.mydomain.com {
    tls {
        client_auth {
            mode require_and_verify
            trusted_ca_cert_file /data/client_certs/client.crt
        }
    }
    reverse_proxy internal_server.lan:2283
}
```

## Using Traefik
### Traefik docker-compose.yaml
```yaml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:3.5
    container_name: traefik
    hostname: traefik
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Madrid
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/traefik
```

### Configure Traefik dynamic file:
```yaml
http:
  services:
    immich:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://immich:2283"

  routers:
    immich:
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      service: immich
      rule: "Host(`immich.mydomain.com`)"
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
        options: mtlsOptions

tls:
  options:
    mtlsOptions:
      minVersion: VersionTLS12
      cipherSuites:
        - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
      clientAuth:
        caFiles:
          - /etc/traefik/certs/client.crt
        clientAuthType: RequireAndVerifyClientCert
```
